The purpose of this project is to create a small-scale prototype autonomous cultivator to
reduce the need of manual labor. The design of the cultivator will benefit small scale
farmers and gardeners with its battery operated and user-friendly phone app. Utilizing
Bluetooth the cultivator will communicate with the phone app and calculate the optimal
path for cultivation based on user input. In addition, the cultivator will employ obstacle
detection and avoidance capabilities using ultrasonic sensors. The goal of the project is
to create the basic foundation for future upscaled autonomous farming tools.
