updates on integration:
milestone before Feb 3:
Integrate phone app and motors
Use motors to perform simple routes
Fix accelerameter and gps issues

update ZhiMing Zhu:
I ran the motor to run a full square,
delay for 2000 at speed 150 makes a almost perfect 90 degree turn
the run was successful
will now run the motor with mapping algorithm and later run the motor with communication moduel
runMotor and Mapping is two of my completed subsystems
a new file will be uploaded later when motor and mapping is integrated into each other
