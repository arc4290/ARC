updates on integration:
milestone before Feb 3:
Integrate phone app and motors
Use motors to perform simple routes
Fix accelerameter and gps issues

update ZhiMing Zhu:
I ran the motor to run a full square,
delay for 2000 at speed 150 makes a almost perfect 90 degree turn
the run was successful
will now run the motor with mapping algorithm and later run the motor with communication moduel
runMotor and Mapping is two of my completed subsystems
a new file will be uploaded later when motor and mapping is integrated into each other


Update Jesse Gomez (IN PROGRESS):
Currently working and adressing the fusion of the MPU6050 Accel/Gyro and ADA746 GPS
MPU6050 proving to be very diffficult to integrate
Might need to buy a new microcontroller as the Romeo BLE (ATMega328p) only has 32kb of program space



milestones before Feb 15:
Validate phone app with motors
Validate motors performing simple routes
Validate all sensors with gps
Integrate sensors with motor function
Integrate phone app with sensors for feedback
Completely integrate mapping algorithm with motors
Validate sensors with phone app
Validate sensors with motors
Validate mapping algorithm with motors
